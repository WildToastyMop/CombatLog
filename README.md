*   **Damage Source Control** – Choose if combat triggers from players, mobs, or all damage.
*   **Restrict Movement Items** – Disable elytra flight and ender pearl use during combat.
*   **Command Blacklist** – Block specific commands (like `/home`) while in combat.
*   **Fully Customizable Messages** – Change every alert and death message.
