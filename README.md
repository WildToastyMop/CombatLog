# CombatLog

A simple mod to try to prevent players from leaving while in combat 


## Usage
In order for this mod to be as simple as possible I used architectury to manage the fabric and forge versions and used forgix to combine them in one jar. If this causes any problems feel free to build the version you need yourself and open and issue
## Config
Currently the mod has 3 config options combatTime, allDamage, and deathMessage. combatTime is simply how long a player should be tagged for before they can leave, allDamge is weather you want players to get tagged only from other players or every kind of damage, and deathMessage is just the message displayed when someone leaves while in combat.
## Build
Building this is fairly easy just download intellij community edition then install the minecraft plugin from the plugin store and the architectury plugin go to project settings and make sure the java version is set to 17 for 1.18.2 and 1.19.2 or 8-16 for 1.16.5 the let it index and his gradle on the right expand the tasks arrow find the version you want then just double click build
